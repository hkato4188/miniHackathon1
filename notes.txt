Considerations:
- Name values have commas which makes “,” delimiters like split need extra functionality
- We can also read through each file once, and create a map of values so that we can do multiple subsequent lookups faster

What are we trying to do?
- Write a program:
        Input: Sales Persons Last name
        Output: data associated with that Last Name
- What data?
        Organization Id
        Company Name
        Country
        Industry
        Number of employees
- How are we going to do that?
        We receive user input that represents a sales rep’s last name
            Use java’s i/o classes to look at SalesRep.csv
            Use sales rep last name to find their user id
            Once we find a match -> find the sales rep Id and save it in a variable
                Look through each line’s last name value in SalesRep.csv
                If it matches the input last name return the user Id
                If we do not find a match: print out “no sales rep”
        Match the sales representatives user id with the sales repId field in Company.csv
            Use java’s i/o classes to look at Company.csv
            Use salesRep user id to find associated company through its Sales Repid
            Once we find a match -> return the requested company info at each index
                Look through each line’s sales repid value in Company.csv
                If it matches the user id from SalesRep.csv return the Company object’s requested data
                If we do not find a match: print out “no associated company data”
